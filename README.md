# Auto-Light-Pi
Auto Light Pi is an open-source project designed to automate and optimize room lighting using a Raspberry Pi Pico, a light sensor, and a lamp. The system allows users to set a desired brightness level for their room; the lamp will automatically adjust its intensity to maintain that target, based on real-time sensor readings.

## ðŸš§ Work in progress
This project is currently **under development**.
For more information and to see the first implementations, see the [`dev`](../../tree/dev) branch.
